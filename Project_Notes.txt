Story Ideas:

 Tutorial Cave:
	You awake in a damp cave, sparce rays of light spotting the ground.
	Upon inspection of your person: You are wearing tattered rags, equipped with only a battered wooden shield and a wooden club.
	Although dark, you can make out the flicker of a fire in the distance, ominous shadows dancing around it.
	As you get closer you can cleary make out green figures, with long pointy ears.
	** Lore check?
		[Lore] Attempt to identify the creatures.
	You identify the two creatures as goblins, and can hear them making gutteral noises while they parade around the fire.
	Smoke from the fire wafts towards you and you realize that the goblins are cooking food. Your stomach grumbles.
	You decide if you want to attack the goblins or attempt to sneak past.
	If defeated you can choose what to do with their equipment and food.
	** Trick food? Human?
	You find a few rusty daggers among the goblins, but nothing else of note.
	
	-More goblin enctounters through the cave-

	*Writing outline below*
	At the end of the cave you find the boss creature, either an orc or an ogre.
	More difficult than the goblins, but nothing crazy.
	**Have the boss say something, mabye some exposition?
	
 Town:
	*Writing outline below*
	Greeted by town mayor/leader.
	**Start with plot dump? (Prop not, boring.)
	**Gather plot from towns folk, option to skip it entirely.
	Mayor/leader tells you to look around town for a bit, and speak with him when you are ready to continure.
	Give reason to even continue in the first place: gold, hero character?, loot, save world?.
	Learn about town and their predicament.
	Buy gear off of merchants.
	
 Dragon's (?) Lair:
	*Writing outline Below*
	Few enemies before boss, less than tutorial. Mostly to test new gear.
	Find end boss, talking sequence.
	**Add option to side with end boss, destroy town?
	Bit of story from boss, fight after.
	**Dialogue during fight?
	Kill boss.
	**More Dialogue?
	Go back to town after looting.

 Back at town:
	Congratulations from towns folk and mayor/leader.
	**More or end?
